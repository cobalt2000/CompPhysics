Code Plan!

Main: creating the memory spaces for
	particle structs (3 arrays of structs)
	matrices (4 arrays)
	yukawas (4 arrays)

	Loop:
		randomize paramaters
	
		pass struct and matrix to diagonalizing function to calc eigenvalues and eigenvectors
		return structs with masses and eigenvectors

		pass structs and yukawa arrays to calc_yukawa 
		return structs with effective yukawas
	
		pass structs to branchingfractions
		returns structs with decay and branching_frac arrays
	
		pass structs to phenotests
		returns with passing/failing observational bounds

		output
	End Loop

free memory

End Main
